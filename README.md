## Utilizing Trackman Data for Hitters
Trackman Data is mainly used for visualizing pitcher data and creating upmire reports. Here I am using the hitting variables for the UNCW hitters for the 22-23 baseball season. It is a spray chart for the batters where you can filter based on which hitter you would like to look at as well as the play result (out, single, etc.)

## Data Acquisition and Cleaning
I was fortunate enought to work with the team during the 22-23 season gathering their data during games. I prepared the data by filtering for just the UNCW batters as well as only balls in play. In the data the only variable for horizontal position of the hit is in degrees so I utilizied trigonometry to try to plot the points in the correct position. 
## Future Work
There is a lot I am planning to do in the future on this project. I am hoping to be able to apply this data to a more real looking field. Additionally I would like to be able to print percentages and number of hits for the batters based on the throwing arm of the pitcher (righty vs lefty). Lastly I am hoping to get in contact with the staff at trackman to see what the recommend for plotting the points since they still arent totally correct.
